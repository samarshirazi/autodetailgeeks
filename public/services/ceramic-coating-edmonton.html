        <h2>Our Ceramic Coating Process</h2>
        <div class="process">
            <div class="process-step">
                <h3>Step 1: Vehicle Inspection & Assessment</h3>
                <p>We begin with a thorough inspection of your vehicle's paint condition. This helps us identify any scratches, swirl marks, or imperfections that need to be addressed before ceramic coating application.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="process-step">
                <h3>Step 2: Deep Cleaning & Decontamination</h3>
                <p>Your vehicle undergoes a comprehensive full body wash, followed by clay bar treatment to remove embedded contaminants from the paint surface. We also perform wheel washing and engine detailing to ensure every part of your vehicle is pristine.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="process-step">
                <h3>Step 3: Paint Correction & Polishing</h3>
                <p>Using professional polishing techniques, we correct paint imperfections, remove swirl marks, and perform scratch removal where possible. This step is crucial for achieving a flawless finish before ceramic coating application.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="process-step">
                <h3>Step 4: Surface Preparation</h3>
                <p>The paint surface is cleaned with isopropyl alcohol to remove any oils, polishing residue, or contaminants. This ensures maximum bonding of the ceramic coating to your vehicle's paint.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="process-step">
                <h3>Step 5: Ceramic Coating Application</h3>
                <p>Our certified technicians apply the ceramic coating panel by panel, ensuring even coverage and proper bonding. This meticulous process requires precision and expertise to achieve optimal results.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="process-step">
                <h3>Step 6: Curing & Final Inspection</h3>
                <p>The ceramic coating is allowed to cure properly in a controlled environment. After curing, we perform a final inspection to ensure the coating has bonded correctly and meets our quality standards.</p>

        <h2>Edmonton's Weather & Your Vehicle's Paint</h2>
        <div class="intro">
            <p>Edmonton experiences some of Canada's most extreme weather conditions, from freezing winters with heavy road salt use to intense summer UV exposure. These conditions can be brutal on your vehicle's paintwork. Winter road salt is particularly corrosive, while spring brings acid rain and pollen. Summer's intense UV rays cause paint oxidation and fading, and fall introduces tree sap and moisture.</p>

            <p>Ceramic coating provides superior protection against all these elements. The hydrophobic properties mean water, snow, and ice slide off more easily, reducing the time contaminants spend on your paint. The UV protection prevents fading and oxidation, while the chemical resistance protects against road salt, bird droppings, and acid rain. For Edmonton car owners, ceramic coating isn't just a luxury—it's an investment in preserving your vehicle's value and appearance.</p>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <div class="faq">
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>How long does ceramic coating last in Edmonton's climate?</h3>
                <p>With proper maintenance, our professional-grade ceramic coating can last 3-5 years, even in Edmonton's harsh climate. The coating is specifically designed to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations, road salt, and UV exposure. We recommend regular washing and annual inspections to maximize the coating's lifespan.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Is ceramic coating better than car waxing?</h3>
                <p>Yes, ceramic coating provides significantly better and longer-lasting protection than traditional car waxing. While wax needs reapplication every 2-3 months, ceramic coating lasts for years. Ceramic coating also offers superior protection against scratches, chemicals, UV rays, and environmental contaminants. The hydrophobic properties are much stronger, making your vehicle easier to clean and maintain.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>How much does ceramic coating cost in Edmonton?</h3>
                <p>Ceramic coating prices vary depending on your vehicle's size, paint condition, and the level of paint correction required. Generally, professional ceramic coating in Edmonton ranges from $800 to $2,500. We offer free quotes and will assess your vehicle to provide an accurate estimate. Remember, this is a long-term investment that protects your vehicle's value and reduces maintenance costs over time.</p>
